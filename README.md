Sales of a second house through ‘NFT’ at Sahara Resort, the host site 
of the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics


Sahara Issues Property Rights as NFTs and Trades in Bitcoin
15% cheaper than cash purchase price hosted by online sales

 

Sahara Street LLC announced that the second house of the Pyeongchang Sahara Resort, the host city of the 2018 Winter Olympics, will be sold next month as a non-fungible token (NFT).

NFT refers to a token that represents a digital asset with scarcity and utilizes blockchain technology. Unlike existing virtual assets, digital assets are not interchangeable by giving them a separate, quiet recognition value.

According to Sahara Street LLC, the second house to be sold through NFT is located in Pyeongchang, the host city of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. It features a view overlooking the golf course.

It is operated by Sahara Street, a blockchain-based real estate technology company headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, USA, and will issue property rights as NFTs to conduct online sales. The sale price is about 400 million won, but it is possible to buy and sell it at about 15% cheaper when trading with Bitcoin or Sahara tokens.

With the advantage of being the host of the Winter Olympics, the company explains that it is possible to generate additional revenue by providing accommodations to ski enthusiasts and seasonal visitors in winter.


The operator, Sahara Street, said: "Issuing real estate titles as NFTs will allow homeowners to sell their homes as quickly as an online shopping transaction."

Sahara Street said that it is developing a platform using original technology that allows digital real estate assets to form a higher value than traditional real estate asset values through the platform while operating a meta Sahara resort using GPS in the metaverse space. .
